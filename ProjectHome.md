After creating a lightweight implementation of a runtime compiler for a "yield return"-like feature, it's only logical to create a Collections library which is easy to make and even easier to maintain. Please read the [Introduction](Introduction.md) page to get more information.

The first step is to create a specialized iterators library. This will both help improve the yield feature and create a lighter iterators library than what exists today.

The next steps could be anything - From algorithms to advancing the runtime-compiler idea.
